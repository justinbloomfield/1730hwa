This program provides 4 different levels of functionality, each found in files called funct_1.py through funct_4.py. Each functionality level builds on the previous ones; so, for example, funct_4 does everything that the previous three programs can, as well as its own task.

The first level, found in funct_1.py, will prompt you to input a file path, and a sea level rise in metres. Please make sure the file you specify is in the YXZ format (three values per line separated by spaces). If the file is not in this format, an error will be reported when the program tries to validate it, and printed to the terminal . This is the case for all four programs. If the file type is correct, the program will then report how much land would be above water if the sea rose by this amount, and what percentage of the current land area this is. These values are found using the first (basic) area approximation. To use it, run the program and input a sea level rise. The data will be printed to the terminal; you can find it there.

The second level, found in funct_2.py, will also show you a lovely graph plotting the land area above water for a range of sea level rises (this range being from 0 to the highest elevation in your data file, at 1% increments of the highest elevation). This calculation also uses the first (basic) area approximation. The program will still prompt you to enter a sea level rise in metres; if you would like a graph to be displayed, please enter this value as 0. If you enter a non-zero value, the program will run identically to funct_1. The graph output will be shown in a separate window when the program terminates; if it doesn't come up on your screen automatically, look for it in your taskbar. From there, you can change the viewing window or save the graph to your computer using the buttons at the bottom of the window.

The third level, found in funct_3.py, does the same thing as the first and second levels, but calculates all data using both the first (basic) approximation used before, and a second, more accurate approximation that takes into account the natural curvature of the Earth. This program can be used identically to funct_2.py; simply input a non-zero sea level rise to see the remaining area as in function 1, or input 0 to see not one, but two pretty graphs. The title of each graph will indicate which approximation was used to create it.

The fourth level, found in funct_4.py, does everything found in function 3, as well as a special bonus feature! In addition to working out the land area (and percentage) remaining or creating pretty graphs, funct_4 will calculate the number of distinct islands above the new sea level you input. NB: if you input the sea level as 0 (in order to get the pretty graphs), the number of islands will be determined at the current sea level, as this corresponds to no sea level rise at all. Once again, the number of islands will be printed to the terminal.
